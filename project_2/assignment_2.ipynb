    "analyses of your results. Beyond answering why you got the results you did you should compare and contrast the different algorithms. How fast were they in terms of wall clock time? Iterations? Which algorithm performed best? How do you define best? Be creative and think of as many questions you can, and as many answers as you can. You know the drill."
